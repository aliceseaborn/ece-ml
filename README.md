# ECE Machine Learning
---

Notes and projects for the Machine Learning for Engineers (ECE 465) course taken at Bradley University in the Spring of 2019. To the best of my ability, I have kept these resources in their original form but I have verified that the notebooks are functional.

To get up and running, use the requirements file to install dependencies and then launch JupyterLab. You can use Conda to accomplish these steps with ease:
```BASH
conda create -y -n ece-ml python
conda activate ece-ml
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
conda install -y -c conda-forge jupyterlab
jupyterlab
```
These instructions were verified using the Anaconda Python (ver. 3.2020.11). All commands were executed using the conda binary (ver. 4.10.1). The test system was a laptop running 64-bit Debian 5.10.28 on an Intel chipset.
